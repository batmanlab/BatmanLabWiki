# Software Purpose

# This is a bash script for launching a jupyter notebook from an interactive
# node. It assumes that the user has local ssh terminals on their desktop. 
# This works for GNU/Linux and MacOS users, but Windows does not have terminal
# support by default outside of Cygwin and Ubuntu Windows 10 Feature users.

#store hostname in a string
HOSTSTRPVT=`hostname`
HOSTSTR=$(echo $HOSTSTRPVT | sed 's/pvt/opa/g')
# if the user passes any command args at all, interpret it as a request for help

if [ -z $1 ]; then
# Only do this stuff on an interactive node. 
	if [[ "$HOSTSTR" = br00?.opa.bridges.psc.edu ]]; then
		echo "You are on" $HOSTSTR "which is a login node"
		echo "You must be on an interactive node to run this software."
        	echo "Type 'interact' at the prompt and try again"
	else

# Setup software paths
	    export ANACONDA_HOME=/home/batmangh/anaconda2
	    export PYTHON_ROOT=/home/batmangh/anaconda2
	    export JUPYTER_RUNTIME_DIR=/home/batmangh/runtime

# create directory. it doesn't hurt anything if it already exists.
#		mkdir -p ~/.jupyter

# Setup Jupyter rundir. Perhaps this step should move to a module.
#		export JUPYTER_RUNTIME_DIR=~/.jupyter

# change the directory, otherwise you are dumped into pwd
#		cd ~/.jupyter

# find the last port that someone used
        	declare -i portnum=8888

		portused=$(netstat -nat | grep $portnum)

		while [ ! -z "$portused" ]; do
			echo $portused
			portnum=portnum+1
			portused=$(netstat -nat | grep $portnum)
			echo "new port assigned" $portnum
     		done
 

# User instructions
		echo "Your Jupyter Notebook is ready for use."
		echo "------------------------"
		echo "Step 1:"
		echo "Mac/Linux users: launch another terminal and paste the following command:"
		echo "ssh -L $portnum:$HOSTSTR:$portnum bridges.psc.edu -l `whoami`"
		echo "Windows users: run "cmd" then cd to yor PuTTY directory then pased the following command:"
		echo "plink  -L $portnum:$HOSTSTR:$portnum bridges.psc.edu -l `whoami`"
		echo "------------------------"
		echo "Step 2: Open a browser on your computer to http://localhost:$portnum"
		echo "Step 3: Enjoy Jupyter Notebook!"


# Launch the notebook
        	jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=$portnum
